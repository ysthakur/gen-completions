.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
sway was created to fill the need of an i3-like window manager for Wayland.\& The
upstream i3 developers have no intention of porting i3 to Wayland, and projects
proposed by others ended up as vaporware.\& Many thanks to the i3 folks for
providing such a great piece of software, so good that your users would rather
write an entirely new window manager from scratch that behaved \fIexactly\fR like i3
rather than switch to something else.\&
.PP
You can run sway directly from a tty, or via a Wayland-compatible login manager.\&
.PP
.SH CONFIGURATION
.PP
sway searches for a config file in the following locations, in this order:
.PP
.PD 0
.IP 1. 4
~/.\&sway/config
.IP 2. 4
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/sway/config (suggested location)
.IP 3. 4
~/.\&i3/config
.IP 4. 4
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/i3/config
.IP 5. 4
/etc/sway/config
.IP 6. 4
/etc/i3/config
.PD
.PP
If unset, $XDG_CONFIG_HOME defaults to \fI~/.\&config\fR.\&
.PP
An error is raised when no config file is found.\& The recommended default
configuration is usually installed to \fI/etc/sway/config\fR; you are encouraged to
copy this to \fI~/.\&config/sway/config\fR and edit it from there.\&
.PP
For information on the config file format, see \fIsway\fR(5).\&
.PP
.SH IPC COMMANDS
.PP
Though \fIswaymsg\fR(1) is generally preferred, you may run \fIsway\fR \fIcommand\fR to
send \fIcommand\fR to the running instance of sway.\& You can also issue commands
with \fIi3-msg\fR(1) or even with \fIi3\fR(1).\&
.PP
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.PP
The following environment variables have an effect on sway:
.PP
\fISWAYSOCK\fR
Specifies the path to the sway IPC socket.\&
.PP
\fIXKB_DEFAULT_RULES\fR, \fIXKB_DEFAULT_MODEL\fR, \fIXKB_DEFAULT_LAYOUT\fR,
\fIXKB_DEFAULT_VARIANT\fR, \fIXKB_DEFAULT_OPTIONS\fR
Configures the xkb keyboard settings.\& See \fIxkeyboard-config\fR(7).\& The
preferred way to configure the keyboard is via the configuration file, see
\fIsway-input\fR(5).\&
.PP
The following environment variables are set by sway:
.PP
\fIDISPLAY\fR
If compiled with Xwayland support and Xwayland is not disabled by the
config, this will be set to the name of the X display used for Xwayland.\&
.PP
\fII3SOCK\fR
For compatibility with i3, specifies the path to the sway IPC socket.\&
.PP
\fISWAYSOCK\fR
Specifies the path to the sway IPC socket.\&
.PP
\fIWAYLAND_DISPLAY\fR
Specifies the name of the Wayland display that sway is running on.\&
.PP
